This directory is for intermediate compilation of scholia translations submitted to the HMT project.

## Work flow

1.  An HMT editor marks a submitted as approved by closing it, preferably with a standard comment such as "Translation of scholion SCHOLION_URN accepted for publication in the HMT project."
2. An HMT manager (such as Chris or Neel) labels the closed issue as "transferred" and adds it to the intermediate compilation in CEX format in this directory.
3. The contents of intermediate storage are not in document order.  When they are added to the HMT archive, the correct computational order will need to be imposed computationally.

## Formatting CEX

- The final value of a citable scholion node should be either `lemma` or `comment`
-  The version of the passage should be the user's github name.
