urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.caseydue:1.1034.comment:#It is likely that the poet forms the names [of Briseis and Chryseis] patronymically and not by proper name. For as other ancient [poets] relate, Chryseis was called Astynome, and Briseis was called Hippodameia. And the trope is antonomasia [= "use of an epithet, patronymic, or appellative for a proper name" Liddell-Scott-Jones, s.v. ἀντονομασία].
