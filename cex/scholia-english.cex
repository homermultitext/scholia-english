urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.caseydue:18.162.comment#[There is a sign] because Zenodotus athetized the rest after this verse, satisfied with the summary preface. But Homer would not have narrated in tragic style the things in the bellows, if he was not intending to incorporate the preparation of the decoration

urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.caseydue:1.1034.comment:#It is likely that the poet forms the names [of Briseis and Chryseis] patronymically and not by proper name.

(Translation adapted from that of Dué and Ebbott, *Iliad 10 and the Poetics of Ambush*, p. 67.)
